print('''In the quiet of dusk's embrace,
Dreams take flight, a gentle grace.
Through the whispers of the trees,
Life hums soft, carried by the breeze.
Stars awake in velvet skies,
Casting light where wonder lies.
Every shadow, every spark,
Holds a story in the dark.
Walk the path where hearts may lead,
Plant the seeds of every deed.
For in each moment, deep and small,
Lies the beauty that binds us all.''' )
